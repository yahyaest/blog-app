Setting up HTTPS in a local development environment is crucial for simulating production-like scenarios, especially when dealing with secure communications. However, dealing with SSL certificates in local environments can be tricky. This guide walks you through the process of creating your own SSL Certificate Authority (CA) and using it to issue certificates for your local development sites.

> The objective of this guide is to create a self-signed root certificate and use it to sign certificates for local development sites. This approach is suitable for local development environments and should not be used in production.

> For this guide, we will use a dockerized crypto simulator trade application and set up a local secure https url `https://trade-sim.com` . you can visit the hosted website [here](https://crypto-simulator-trade.herokuapp.com/).

> The app is based on microservice architecture that simulates trading of cryptocurrencies. It has Gateway, Crypto and Wallet services built with NestJS, a Task Scheduler service based on Django, a notification service based on FastAPI, a websocket service and a frontend built with NextJS. 

> We will go back to these services language/framework later when dealing with trusting the local Certificate Authority (CA) .

## Introduction

In 2018, Google began encouraging the use of HTTPS encryption by marking sites without SSL certificates as "not secure" in Chrome. This move was widely embraced because it enhances the security of web traffic for both site owners and their visitors.

While services like Let’s Encrypt and its API have simplified the process of obtaining and installing SSL certificates for live sites, they don't offer much help for developers working in local environments. Generating a local SSL certificate for development purposes can be complex, and even with a self-signed certificate, you may still encounter privacy errors in browsers.

## Why HTTPS Locally?
Why should you bother with HTTPS in a local development environment?
Why not just use regular HTTP locally?

The answer is simple: to simulate production-like scenarios. When you develop a web application, you want to ensure that it behaves as expected in a production environment. This includes testing how it handles secure communications over HTTPS.

With this approch, you can catch issues related to mixed content, insecure requests, and other security-related problems early in the development process. This can save you time and effort by preventing issues from reaching production.

If you’ve ever tried to browse to a local site via HTTPS, which doesn’t have an SSL certificate configured, you’ve probably seen the following message in Chrome:

<Image

  width="718"
  height="404"
  alt="Image"
  sizes="100vw"
  className="align-middle self-center w-full h-auto rounded-lg"
/>
Or the following in Firefox:

  className="align-middle self-center w-full h-auto rounded-lg"
/>
## Prerequisites

### Map the Host to the Nginx Service IP
For this to work you need to map the host `trade-sim.com` to the nginx docker service ip. 

To do this you need first to get the ip of the nginx service by running the following command:

```bash
docker inspect nginx | grep "IPAddress"
```

The result should look like this:

```bash
"SecondaryIPAddresses": null,
"IPAddress": "",
        "IPAddress": "192.168.0.12",
```

In this case, the ip of the nginx service is `192.168.0.12`


Then you need to map the host `trade-sim.com` to the ip of the nginx service.

You can do this by adding the following line to your `/etc/hosts` file (you need to have root access with `sudo` to do this):

```bash
192.168.0.12 trade-sim.com 
```

> This is curcial since we don't have a DNS record for `trade-sim.com` so the browser will look for `/etc/hosts` to resolve the domain name to the ip of the nginx service.


### Nginx Configuration
When working witn nginx in local development, your default.conf file should look like this:

```nginx
server {
  listen       80;
  listen  [::]:80;
  server_name trade-sim.com;

  location / {
    ....
  }
}
```

This is the default configuration for a local development environment with HTTP protocol on port 80.We will modify this configuration to include HTTPS at port 443.

The end goal is to have a configuration that looks like this:

```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name trade-sim.com;

  ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/trade-sim.com/trade-sim.com.fullchain.pem;

  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/trade-sim.com/trade-sim.com.key;

  location / {
    ....
  }
}
```

Where `trade-sim.com.fullchain.pem` and `trade-sim.com.key` are the SSL certificate and key files respectively that we will generate with our local Certificate Authority (CA).



## Step 1: Create a Root Certificate Authority

> In the next steps, we will need OpenSSL to create a root certificate authority (CA) and local service certificate

To create a local CA, follow these steps:

Create a directory for your certificates and navigate to it.This is not a requirement, but it makes it easier to find the keys later.

```bash
mkdir ~/certs
cd ~/certs
```

1- Generate a private key `myCA.key` to act as the root CA:

```bash
openssl genrsa -des3 -out myCA.key 2048
```

You will be prompted to enter a passphrase to secure the key. Make sure to remember this passphrase, as you will need it later.

The output should look like this:

```bash
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
..........................................................................+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
Enter pass phrase for myCA.key:
Verifying - Enter pass phrase for myCA.key:
```

2- Generate a root certificate ``myCA.pem`` using the private key:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key myCA.key -sha256 -days 1825 -out myCA.pem
```
You will be prompted for the passphrase of the private key you just chose and a bunch of questions. You can leave these questions blank if you wish.

I suggest making the Common Name something that you’ll recognize as your root certificate in a list of other certificates. That’s really the only thing that matters.

The output should look like this:

```bash

Enter pass phrase for myCA.key:
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:TN
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]: 
Locality Name (eg, city) []:
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:LocalRootCA
Email Address []: any@gmail.com
```

> For this guide, the root certificate Common Name is set to `LocalRootCA`

## Step 2: Adding the Root Certificate to Linux
For Linux systems, add the root certificate to the trusted CA list:

1 - Copy the root certificate to the trusted directory:

```bash
sudo cp ~/certs/myCA.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/myCA.crt
```

2 - Update the trusted certificates:

```bash
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

3 - Verify that the root certificate has been added to the trusted list:

```bash
awk -v cmd='openssl x509 -noout -subject' '/BEGIN/{close(cmd)};{print | cmd}' < /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt | grep LocalRootCA
```

Output should resemble:

```bash
subject=C = TN, ST = Some-State, L = NB, O = Internet Widgits Pty Ltd, CN = LocalRootCA, emailAddress = any@gmail.com
```

## Step 3: Generate CA-Signed Certificates for Your Dev Sites

Now that you have a root certificate authority, you can use it to sign certificates for your local development sites.

1 - Generate a private key for the domain:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out trade-sim.com.key 2048
```

2 - Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR):

```bash
openssl req -new -key trade-sim.com.key -out trade-sim.com.csr
```

You’ll get all the same questions as you did above and, again, your answers don’t matter. The only thing that matters is the Common Name. This should be the domain name you’re creating the certificate for.In this case, it is `trade-sim.com`.

3 - Create a configuration file `trade-sim.com.ext` to specify the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) for the certificate:

```yaml
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1 = trade-sim.com
```

4 - Generate the signed certificate:

```bash
openssl x509 -req -in trade-sim.com.csr -CA ~/certs/myCA.pem -CAkey ~/certs/myCA.key \
-CAcreateserial -out trade-sim.com.crt -days 825 -sha256 -extfile trade-sim.com.ext
```

Here we are using the root certificate `myCA.pem` and private key `myCA.key` to sign the certificate for `trade-sim.com`.

## Step 4: Configure Nginx to Use the SSL Certificate

Now that you have the signed certificate, you can configure Nginx to use it.

1 - Create a fullchain certificate file 

Before you can use the certificate, you need to combine the domain server certificate `trade-sim.com.crt`  and the root certificate `myCA.pem` into a single file `trade-sim.com.fullchain.pem`. This is because Nginx requires the certificate and the key to be in the same file.

> Ensure your full chain file is ordered correctly:<br/>
1-Server Certificate: Your site's certificate (trade-sim.com.crt).<br/>
2-Root CA Certificate: Your local CA root certificate (myCA.pem).

It will look like this:

```bash
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
(Your Primary SSL certificate: trade-sim.com.crt)
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
(Your root certificate: myCA.pem)
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```


2 - Map the certificate and key to the Nginx docker service volume

In your `docker-compose.yml` file, add the following volumes to the Nginx service:

```yaml
volumes:
  - path-to-key-file/trade-sim.com.key:/etc/letsencrypt/live/trade-sim.com/trade-sim.com.key
  - path-to-cert-file/trade-sim.com.fullchain.pem:/etc/letsencrypt/live/trade-sim.com/trade-sim.com.fullchain.pem
```

3 - Update the Nginx configuration to use the SSL certificate:

```nginx
server {
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name trade-sim.com;

  ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/trade-sim.com/trade-sim.com.fullchain.pem;

  ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/trade-sim.com/trade-sim.com.key;

  location / {
    ....
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Trust the Local Certificate Authority in Browsers

To avoid privacy errors in browsers, you need to trust the local CA in your browser.

### Trust the Local CA in Chrome

1 - Open Chrome’s Certificate Manager:

* Go to chrome://settings/.
* Search for Manage Certificates.

2 - Import the Root CA Certificate

* Go to the Authorities tab.
* Click Import and select your myCA.pem file.
* Choose to trust it for websites.

Now when you visit your local development site `https://trade-sim.com`, you should see that your site is secure.

  className="align-middle self-center w-full h-auto rounded-lg"
/>

### Trust the Local CA in Firefox

1 - Open Firefox Manager

* Go to Preferences > Privacy & Security > Certificates > View Certificates

2 - Import the Root CA Certificate

* Go to the Authorities tab.
* Click Import and select your myCA.pem file.
* Check the box for "Trust this CA to identify websites."

Similar to Chrome, you should now see that your site is secure in Firefox.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Error: `Error: Self-Signed Certificate in Certificate Chain`

Some services (like Node.js or Python-based frameworks) might not automatically trust your local CA.

To fix this, you need to add the root certificate to the trusted certificates in your programming language.

#### Node.js (Express, NestJS, NextJS etc.)

Node.js does not automatically trust custom or self-signed CA certificates. You need to configure it to trust your local CA.

Add the following to your docker-compose services that use Node.js:

```yaml
environment:
  - NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/myCA.pem
volumes:
  - path-to-ca-root-file/myCA.pem:/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/myCA.pem
```

Here we set the `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` environment variable to point to your CA certificate. This tells Node.js to include the specified CA certificate in its trust store.

Besides, we map the CA certificate to the `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` directory in the container.

Then, restart the service:

```bash
docker-compose restart service-name
```

#### Python (Django, FastAPI etc.)

In Python, The error will look like this:

```bash
requests.exceptions.SSLError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='trade-sim.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: / (Caused by SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self-signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1006)')))
```

Just like Node.js, Python does not trust custom or self-signed CA certificates by default. You need to configure it to trust your local CA.

Add the following to your docker-compose services that use Python:

```yaml
environment:
  - REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/myCA.pem
volumes:
  - path-to-ca-root-file/myCA.pem:/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/myCA.pem
```

Here we set the `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable to point to your CA certificate. This tells Python to include the specified CA certificate in its trust store.

Besides, like node services we map the CA certificate to the `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` directory in the container.

Then, restart the service:

```bash
docker-compose restart service-name
```

## Conclusion

In this guide, you learned how to create your own SSL Certificate Authority (CA), use it to issue certificates for local development sites and use HTTPS on your local sites. 

This approach is suitable for local development environments and ensure that your local environment closely mirrors production.

Hopefully, this will eliminate the dreaded “Your connection is not private” message for you on your local development websites.
