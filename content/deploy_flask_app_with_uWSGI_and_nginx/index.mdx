In today's web development landscape, deploying web applications requires a robust architecture that ensures scalability, security, and optimal performance. This blog post explores the deployment of a Flask application using NGINX as a reverse proxy server and uWSGI as a WSGI server. This architecture not only enhances the application's ability to handle high traffic but also improves security through SSL/TLS encryption and provides efficient load balancing capabilities.


>The following sections will detail the components involved, the typical request flow from client to application, and the advantages of this architectural approach.

### Components

- **Client:** This is the user or application that interacts with the web application. It can be a web browser, mobile device, or another software application.
 
- **NGINX:** NGINX is a reverse proxy server that sits in front of the web server (uWSGI) and the Flask application. It acts as a load balancer, distributing traffic among multiple web servers and improving the application's performance and scalability. NGINX can also handle SSL/TLS encryption and decryption, improve security.

- **uWSGI:** uWSGI is a web server gateway interface (WSGI) server. It translates requests from the reverse proxy server (NGINX) into a format that the Flask application can understand and vice versa.
 
- **Flask application:** This is the Python web application built with the Flask framework. It handles the application logic, such as processing user input, interacting with databases, and generating responses.

- **Docker:** Provides containerization for the Flask application, facilitating deployment and scalability.


### Scenario

**1.Client sends a request:** The client (web browser, mobile device, etc.) initiates a request to the web application by entering a URL in the address bar or clicking on a link. The request includes information about the requested resource, such as the path, headers, and any data being sent to the server (e.g., form data).

**2.Request reaches NGINX:** The request is routed to the NGINX server.

**3.NGINX distributes request:** NGINX can handle multiple web servers running the Flask application. It distributes the request to an available uWSGI web server.

**4.uWSGI translates request:** The uWSGI server receives the request from NGINX and translates it into a format that the Flask application can understand (WSGI).

**5.uWSGI forwards request to Flask:** uWSGI forwards the translated request to the Flask application.

**6.Flask application processes request:** The Flask application processes the request, which may involve interacting with a database, performing calculations, or generating content.

**7.Flask generates response:** The Flask application generates a response that includes the requested data (e.g., HTML content, JSON data) and an HTTP status code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).

**8.Flask sends response to uWSGI:** The Flask application sends the response back to the uWSGI server.

**9.uWSGI translates response:** uWSGI translates the response back into a format that NGINX can understand (usually HTTP).

**10.uWSGI sends response to NGINX:** uWSGI forwards the translated response to NGINX.

**11.NGINX sends response to client:** NGINX sends the response back to the client.

**12.Client receives response:** The client receives the response from NGINX and displays it to the user (e.g., renders an HTML page in the web browser).

### Benefits of this architecture

* **Scalability:** NGINX can distribute traffic among multiple web servers, which allows the application to handle a high volume of traffic.

* **Security:** NGINX can handle SSL/TLS encryption and decryption, which helps to protect sensitive data transmissions between the client and the server.

* **Performance:** NGINX can cache static content, such as images and CSS files, which can improve the application's performance.

* **Load balancing:** NGINX can distribute traffic among multiple web servers, which helps to improve the application's responsiveness.

```

## Production Deployment

> For this is demo pc-builder-app is the name of the Flask application

### NGINX Configuration
Under '**_/etc/nginx/conf.d/server.conf_**' add flask app location : 
```
location /pc-builder-app/ {
        proxy_pass             http://127.0.0.1:5001;
        proxy_read_timeout     60;
        proxy_connect_timeout  60;
        proxy_redirect         off;

        # Allow the use of websockets
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
   }
```
>In this demo we are using '**/pc-builder-app/**' as subdomain

### Docker Configuration
In the docker-compose file, Add Domain and Environment to the flask app environment variables running with docker : 

```
services:
  pc-builder-app:
    container_name: pc-builder-app
    ...
    environment:
      - DOMAIN=/pc-builder-app
      - ENV=PROD
    ...
```

### Flask app configuration
- In app.py (main.py) : 

Implement Flask Blueprint to add app domain/subdomain to all application routes, templates and static files.

```
from flask import Flask, Blueprint

#Import of environment variables
environment = os.environ['ENV']
app_domain = os.environ['DOMAIN'] if environment == 'PROD' else ''

app_bp = Blueprint('app_bp', __name__,
    template_folder='templates',
    static_folder='static')

#Apply Bluprint 'app_bp' to route
@app_bp.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html', app_domain=app_domain)

#Apply Blueprint with url_prefix in production mode after all routes
if environment == "PROD":
    app.register_blueprint(app_bp, url_prefix=app_domain)
else:
    app.register_blueprint(app_bp)

if __name__ == "__main__":
...
```
- In template files : 

1 - Pass app_domain to route props : 

```
app_domain = os.environ['DOMAIN'] if environment == 'PROD' else ''

@app_bp.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html', app_domain=app_domain)
```

2 - Add app_domain to css link stylesheet, js script, images and a tag href : 

```
<script src="..{{ app_domain }}/static/js/main.js"></script>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="..{{ app_domain }}/static/css/main.css" />

<img src="..{{ app_domain }}/static/images/ccmainbanner-1.jpg" alt="" />

#link to main.html (/main)
<a class="btn btn-success" href="{{ url_for('app_bp.main') }}">Build your own PC</a>
```

- In JS files :

1 - Pass app_domain (eg : main.html)  with the script tag : 

```
<script>var appDomain = "{{ app_domain }}";</script>
```

2 - consume app_domain in dedicated JS file (eg : main.js) : 

```
window.document.location = appDomain + "/order";
```

## Summary
>Deploying a Flask application with NGINX and uWSGI provides a robust foundation for scalable and secure web applications. By leveraging NGINX's capabilities as a reverse proxy server and uWSGI's efficient handling of WSGI requests, you can enhance your application's performance and reliability. This architecture not only facilitates load balancing and SSL/TLS encryption but also streamlines deployment processes in production environments.

In summary, understanding and implementing this architecture ensures that your Flask applications are well-equipped to handle varying levels of traffic while maintaining high standards of security and performance.
